1. This repo contains the code of First Come First Serve, Shortest Job First and Round Robin job schedulers.
```
for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
        scanf("%d%d%d%d",&p[i][0],&p[i][1],&p[i][2],&p[i][3]);
}
```
2. The input is fixed to be named “input.txt”, if one wants to change the name of the input file, one needs to change the code at line 281 from “input.txt” to “yourfilename.txt”

3. The program assumes that all processes have a non-zero CPU time and a non-zero I/O time.
